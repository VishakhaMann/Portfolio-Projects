**Code:** [`Academic-Performance-of-Students.ipynb`](https://github.com/VishakhaMann/Portfolio-Projects/blob/a0479ca15cf0cc639861244dbc4c2c146ebec06e/Academic-Performance-of-Students.ipynb)

### Objective
The goal of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of how various contextual elements influence the educational outcomes and achievements of students.

**Description**: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of academic performance of students. The dataset included gender, race/ethnicity,	parental level of education,	lunch,	test preparation course,	math score,	reading score,	writing score .The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results**: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that 
1. Economic disparities may influence student achievement, as data shows that students from households with higher incomes, who are more likely to select standard lunches, often demonstrate greater academic success. 
2. Race/ehnicity/Gender has no major influence on the academic performance of students.
3. Higher parental level of education has a positive impact on the academic performance of students.
