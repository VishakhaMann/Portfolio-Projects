# Portfolio-Projects
Aspiring Business Analyst, Seeking entry-level opportunities in Business Intelligence / Data Analysis. I'm eager to join an organisation that fosters skill development and offers a positive environment for applying these skills to improve business results.

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## 1. Market Trend Analysis
**Code:** [`Market Trend Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/VishakhaMann/Portfolio-Projects/blob/aa8cad9b322f06d418d4fad911e4b3722b158236/Market%20Trend%20Analysis.ipynb)

### Objective
The goal is to analyze the provided data set to identify the root causes of the issue regarding the inefficiency of recent marketing campaigns and recommend data-driven solutions.

**Description**: The project analyzed a dataset of marketing campaigns accepted by customers, which included features such as income, recency, complaints, response, marital status, amount spent on various products, campaigns accepted, and other family demographics.

**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results**: 
1. Advertising Campaign Acceptance:
Acceptance is positively correlated with income and negatively correlated with having kids/teens.
Suggested Action: Develop two targeted advertising campaign streams: one for high-income individuals without kids/teens, and another for lower-income individuals with kids/teens.

2. Product Success:
The most successful products are wines and meats, as these categories show the highest average customer spending.
Suggested Action: Enhance advertising efforts to promote less popular items, leveraging the success of wines and meats as benchmarks.

3. Channel Performance:
Underperforming channels include deals and catalog purchases, with the average customer making fewer purchases through these methods. Conversely, the best-performing channels are web and store purchases, where customers tend to make the most purchases.
Suggested Action: Concentrate advertising campaigns on the more successful channels (web and store) to maximize customer reach and engagement.

## 2. Academic-Performance-of-Students
**Code:** [`Academic-Performance-of-Students.ipynb`](https://github.com/VishakhaMann/Portfolio-Projects/blob/a0479ca15cf0cc639861244dbc4c2c146ebec06e/Academic-Performance-of-Students.ipynb)

### Objective
The goal of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of how various contextual elements influence the educational outcomes and achievements of students.

**Description**: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of academic performance of students. The dataset included gender, race/ethnicity,	parental level of education,	lunch,	test preparation course,	math score,	reading score,	writing score .The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results**: Using Python functions the analysis revealed that 
1. Economic disparities may influence student achievement, as data shows that students from households with higher incomes, who are more likely to select standard lunches, often demonstrate greater academic success. 
2. Race/ehnicity/Gender has no major influence on the academic performance of students.
3. Higher parental level of education has a positive impact on the academic performance of students.
